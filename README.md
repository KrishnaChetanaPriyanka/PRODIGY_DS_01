## Project Overview 
Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech For this task, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world_population_dataset. The focus was on crafting meaningful visualizations to effectively represent the distributions of both categorical and continuous variables, offering clear and actionable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for this task is the *world_population_dataset*, which contains population data spanning the years 2001 to 2022.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of the EDA process, I carried out the following steps:  

- **Data Cleaning:** Identified and addressed issues such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability.  
- **Visualization:** Designed bar charts and stacked charts to visually analyze the distribution of variables across various categories and years.

## Results/Findings
A ranking of countries based on their male and female population counts for the year 2022.
